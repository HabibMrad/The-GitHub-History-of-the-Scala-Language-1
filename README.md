We're going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

The dataset we will use, which has been previously mined and extracted directly from GitHub, is comprised of two files:

1. pulls.csv contains the basic information about the pull requests.
2. pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request.
